# Enterprise Network Design â€” Cloud Co (Cisco Packet Tracer)
Multi-branch enterprise network design using Cisco Packet Tracer (VLANs, OSPF, HSRP, DHCP, WLC WLAN, Server Farm).

This project was created as part of my networking coursework. It demonstrates the design and implementation of a **multi-branch enterprise network** using Cisco Packet Tracer.  

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- VLAN segmentation & DHCPv4 across multiple LANs  
- OSPF + static routing for WAN connectivity  
- WLAN setup with WLC and WPA2 (Australia)  
- High availability: HSRP and EtherChannel  
- Server Farm (Singapore): DNS, FTP, Web services  
- Layer 2 security (Port Security + attack mitigation)  

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `Enterprise_Network.pkt` â†’ Cisco Packet Tracer topology file  
- `Enterprise_Network_Report.pdf` â†’ Full project documentation (design, configs, screenshots)  

## ðŸš€ How to Use
1. Download `Enterprise_Network.pkt`  
2. Open with **Cisco Packet Tracer**  
3. Refer to the PDF for explanation and setup details
